Data from the paper 'Analysis of solar eruptions deflecting in the low corona: influence of the magnetic environment'

If used cite the paper.

In this study, we aim to compare the 3D trajectories of the events derived from observations with those obtained from the PFSS model (using a source surface at \(r_\text{ss} = 2.5\,R_\sun\)). The eruptive path of an event is defined as the modeled prominence trajectory (represented by a cubic spline), supplemented by the coordinates of the modeled cross-section center from the GCS at \(r_\text{ss}\).

magvB.sav files are too heavy to upload. To reproduce the paper results use the routine pfss_magV.pro with the corresponding date (at asahade/IDL).
