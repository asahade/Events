In this study, we aim to compare the 3D trajectories of the events derived from observations with those obtained from the PFSS model (topological and gradient paths). The eruptive path of an event is defined as the modeled prominence trajectory (represented by a cubic spline), supplemented by the coordinates of the modeled cross-section center from the GCS at 2.5 R_s.
